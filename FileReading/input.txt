flush() just makes sure that any buffered data is written to disk (in this case - more generally, flushed through whatever IO channel you're using). You can still write to the stream (or writer) afterwards.

close() flushes the data and indicates that there isn't any more data. It closes any file handles, sockets or whatever. You then can't write to the stream (or writer) any more.

Note that without calls to flush() data can still be written to the IO channel in question - it's just that some data might be buffered.
